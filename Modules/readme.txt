Much of the flexibility available in PrestaShop is provided by modules. Modules contain a main PHP file, a TPL file for the HTML, and necessary CSS and images.

Modules I have made so far include:

FollowUs
FollowUs is a module for social media icons. Over 20+ social media platforms are supported. An icon set that is free for commercial use is provided for all of the social media platforms. Icons are provided by Linh Pham over at http://linhpham.me/
