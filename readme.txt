Here I will keep a collection of things I work on for PrestaShop. 

Don't know what PrestaShop is?

"PrestaShop is a free, open source e-commerce solution. It supports payment gateways such as DirecPay, Google Checkout, Authorize.Net, Skrill, PayPal, PayPal Payments Pro (Direct) and EBANX Checkout via their respective APIs. Further payment modules are offered commercially.

PrestaShop is available under the Open Software License and officially launched in August 2007. The software, which is written in PHP and based on the Smarty template engine, is currently used by 165,000 shops worldwide.[1] MySQL is the default database engine. PrestaShop is the winner of the 2010 and 2011 Best Open-source Business Application awards.

The PrestaShop group was founded in Paris, with a second Headquarters opened in Miami in 2011.

PrestaShop is translated into 63 languages, with only English, French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish and Russian having full support in all release versions.

Technical support is provided via Paid support plans or free support on the official forum from PrestaShop growing Community consisting of more than 600,000 active members.

The software makes extensive use of AJAX in the admin panel, while module blocks can be easily added to the store to provide extra functionality; these are normally provided free of charge by independent developers.

In March 2014, PrestaShop secured $9.3M in Series B Funding to Fuel Global Expansion

The makers of PrestaShop have an official marketplace for priced modules and themes entitled PrestaShop Addons.

There are a number of volunteers who support and contribute their own Addons to PrestaShop. Contributors often program additional features for the software, on top of the 310 features available by default.

PrestaShop operates an associated website called PrestaBox, which integrates the software into a simple one-stop hosting operation." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrestaShop
